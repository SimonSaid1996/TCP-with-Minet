Group Members:
Brian Lester, Carmen Condeluci

- Completed: 11/14/2015
- CS1652: Data Communications and Computer Networks
- Instructor: Professor Jack Lange
- University of Pittsburgh

Included is the tcp_module.cc file for Minet which is to be placed inside "minet/src/modules".

The following methods have been added or modified in order to achieve our goal of implementing TCP protocol (RFC 793):

- handle_packet
- handle_sock
- handle_timeout
- make_packet
- send_data

Documentation for these methods can be found in the comments of tcp_module.cc. 
Development and testing for this project was mostly completed within the Sennot Square networking lab, room 5506.
